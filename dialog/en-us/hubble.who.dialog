astronomer Edwin Powell Hubble made some of the most important discoveries in modern astronomy. In the 1920s Hubble showed that some of the numerous distant, faint clouds of light in the universe were actually entire galaxies. The realization that the Milky Way is only one of many galaxies forever changed the way humanity views our place in the universe. But perhaps his greatest discovery came in 1929, when Hubble determined that the farther a galaxy is from Earth, the faster it appears to move away. This notion of an expanding universe formed the basis of the big bang theory, which states that the universe began with an intense burst of energy at a single moment in time and has been expanding ever since.
