While there is no “real time” camera or webcam on board the telescope for live relay links, you can find out what Hubble is observing at any time by visiting Space Telescope Live. Usually, Hubble is looking at these targets for the first time, so the images you will see there are from other telescopes, but give you an idea of where Hubble is looking.
