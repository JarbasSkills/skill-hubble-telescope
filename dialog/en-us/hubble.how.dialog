Hubble is a Cassegrain telescope — a type of reflecting telescope. Light enters the telescope and strikes the large primary, or main, mirror. The light is then reflected from the primary mirror onto the secondary mirror, which then focuses the light back through a hole in the primary mirror to a point behind that mirror, where the science instruments are located. Hubble’s primary mirror is 94.5 inches (2.4 meters) in diameter.
